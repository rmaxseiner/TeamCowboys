Code for CS-504 project for Team Cowboys.

# GitHub Basics
I'm no expert here so I have create some instructions but we can update and improve as we go along.  Will be a good group exercise so we cal all learn. 

If you are new to GitHub then I would suggest using the GitHub desktop.  Once you install Github desktop and then you need to use your GitGub credentials to login.

The next step would be to clone a remote repository. 
1. File -> Clone Repository
2. Select: GitHub.com tab (should already be selected, if not select it. )
3. Select: rmaxseiner/TeamCowboys
4. Update: Local Path to the location where you would want to have the files stored on your local machine. 
5. Click: Clone

The files should be now on your local machine and you can edit as normal. 

# Updates needed for below items

# Opening the R Project
In RStudio do the following to create a new project with the GitHub files as its source. 
1. File -> Open Project 
2. select: GMU_OR_568_Group1.Rproj from the local path in the github set-up

# Making Changes visible to others
This is a two step process commit and then push. You essentially have a copy of the repository on your local machine, a branch.  
- Commit says that you want to mark a set of changes in your branch. 
- Push pushes the changes from your local repo to the main repo making it changes everybody can see them and pull them into their own branch.

In RStudio
1. Tools -> Version Control -> Commit
2. Select: The files you want to be included in the commit. 
3. Update: Comment with a description of the changes you made. 
4. Click: Commit 
5. Optional: Click: Push if you want to push to the main repo

If you didn't push the changes then you can do the following 
1. Tools -> Version Control -> Push Branch 
2. This will immediately push any commits to the main branch.

# Getting changes from others
This is easy... just pull.  
1. Tools -> Version Control -> Pull Branches

# Archive
This is how I set-up the project but I don't think this is necessary. 
1. File -> New Project
2. Select: Create from Existing Directory
3. Update: Project Working Directory to what you have selected as your local path in the GitHub set-up
4. Click: Create Project
